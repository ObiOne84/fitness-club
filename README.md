## Bugs ##

> ### *Solved Bugs* ###
>
> - The W3C Validator highlighted an error where thank you page contained an empty h3 heading. This did not affect the website's performance, but an error was resolved by removing the unnecessary heading.
>
> ```html
> before:
>   <h3><i class="fas fa-check-circle submitted-ok"></i></h3>
> after:
>   <i class="fas fa-check-circle submitted-ok"></i>

> - Also, W3CcValidator indicated unsupported elements used in the code
>
> ```html
> before:
>   <h3>Du&#769n Laoghaire</h3>
> after:
>   <h3>Dun Laoghaire</h3>
> ```
>
> - The size of the join page was not responsive; therefore, the CSS file had to be altered, and the form, padding and margins resized.
> - The navigation button was wrapped in an 'a' element. This not affected the website's functionality but was highlighted by W3C Validator as an error.
>
> ```html
> before:
>   <a href="join.html"><button type="button">Join</button></a>
> after:
>   <button onclick="window.location.href='join.html';">Join</button>
